            <p>Nike, Inc. (/ˈnaɪki/ or /ˈnaɪk/)[note 1][3] is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area. It is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel[4] and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$37.4 billion in its fiscal year 2020 (ending May 31, 2020). As of 2020, it employed 76,700 people worldwide.[5] In 2020 the brand alone was valued in excess of $32 billion, making it the most valuable brand among sports businesses.[6] Previously in 2017, the Nike brand was valued at $29.6 billion.[7] Nike ranked No. 89 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[8]

                The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971.
